database change in liquibase = changelog (changelog will maintain the versions of DB changes)
database change in liquibase is measured as changesets 
changeset is the executable Db change in Liquibase.
Liquibase uses changesets to represent a single change to your database.

Inorder to track these changesets liquibase uses the Tracking Table called DATABASECHANGELOG.
Databasechangelog will track if the changeset is deployed or not on the DB.
Liquibase also prevents conflicts from different callersâ€™ updates on a secondary table called DATABASECHANGELOGLOCK.

changes in DB can be written using XML,YAML,SQL,and JSON.

Changelogs and tracking tables allow Liquibase to:

Track and version database changes
Users know which changes have been deployed to the database and which changes have not yet been deployed.

Deploy changes
Liquibase compares the changelog against the tracking table and only deploys changes that have not been deployed to the database.
